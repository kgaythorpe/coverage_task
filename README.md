# Data cleaning task

This repository contains two data files (data_20240120.xlsx and pink_fever_monthly.xlsx) in differing formats. These data are fictionalised vaccination coverage estimates for green fever, blue fever and pink fever.

## Task

Clone the repository and create a branch to work on.

Write a script in R to read both datasets, clean the data where necessary, and produce a figure of coverage over time for all diseases using ggplot2. 

Commit your script and push all edits to your branch.

Open a pull request and let Katy Gaythorpe know.
